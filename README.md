# Email-Spam-Detector
The Email Spam Detector is an intelligent and efficient tool designed to identify and filter out spam emails from our inbox. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and customizable rules, this project aims to enhance our email security and streamline our communication experience.

# Project Features:
1. Machine Learning Classification:
 
 * Employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or legitimate.

  * Regularly updates its models based on user feedback and evolving spam patterns, ensuring adaptive and accurate detection.
2. User-friendly Interface:
* Features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to configure settings and monitor spam detection activities.
* Provides clear feedback on identified spam, allowing users to manage their inbox efficiently.

# Usage: Email Spam Detector
Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI):
* Run the App:
* Open the project folder in your terminal.
* Type streamlit run app.py and press Enter.
* Web browser will open with the Email Spam Detector.

# Model Training:
1. Training the Model:
* If you want to retrain the machine learning model, use the training functionality in the Streamlit app.
  
2. Dataset and Preprocessing:
* The project uses the spam.csv dataset for training and testing.
* Preprocessing steps are automatically handled within the code.
